2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_100MHz_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_100MHz_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell count_seconds/m[5]_i_3__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) count_seconds/m_reg[0]/CLR, count_seconds/m_reg[1]/CLR, count_seconds/m_reg[2]/CLR, count_seconds/m_reg[3]/CLR, count_seconds/m_reg[4]/CLR, count_seconds/m_reg[5]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin debounce_dn/d_prev_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin debounce_dn/q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin debounce_up/d_prev_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin debounce_up/q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/current_duty_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/pwm_out_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/pwm_ramp_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/pwm_ramp_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/pwm_ramp_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/pwm_ramp_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#11 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/pwm_ramp_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#12 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/pwm_ramp_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#13 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/pwm_ramp_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#14 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm_d/pwm_ramp_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
